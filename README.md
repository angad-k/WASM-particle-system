# WASM Particle System :confetti_ball:

### Episode 1 of a number of experiments I have been doing to figure out the ease of coding and benefits of using emscripten to compile C++ to Wasm.

:zap: Check out this [hosted demo](https://angad-k.github.io/WASM-particle-system/) to take this for a spin.

:zap: A max speed of "1" and a force multiplier of "12" seems to give decent results.

:zap: Seems to give good performance upto 1000 particles but starts lagging a little going ahead from there.
